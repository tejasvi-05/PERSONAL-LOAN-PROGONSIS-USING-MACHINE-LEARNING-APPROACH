PERSONAL LOAN PROGONOSIS USING MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH   
DESCRIPTION: This project helps determine if someone will get their loan approved or not based on factors like gender, marital status, and income etc. 
It's built using Python with libraries like Tkinter, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and uses metrics like precision, recall, and F-score. 
Algorithms include Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Voting Classifier.
In this project, we have used Voting Classifier as a hybrid algorithm which is done by using decision tree and random forest algorithms.
We get maximum accuracy by using Voting Classifier Algorithm which is above 80%.
