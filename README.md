Traditional manual methods that can be subjective and slow, our system applicant data like Gender, Education, Credit Score, Finanical history to predict loan approval.

Python libraries used are Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Tkinter.
Machine Learning Algorithms are Random Forest, Naive's Bayes, Voting Classifier(Random Forest + Decision Tree).

**Dataset**: There are 614 application. In which Training dataset are 491 and Testing dataset are 123.
